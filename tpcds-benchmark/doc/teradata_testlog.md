- Create this log. Notes on usage:
	- Use to record test execution notes for Teradata components of the Teradata/Hadoop benchmark 
	- Do not include descriptions of source code changes; these will be captured directly in the project's Git repository

- Sample test (null):
	- Execute test script xyz for concurrency x. Describe issues found/fixed and global notes such as total runtimes and references to detailed results
